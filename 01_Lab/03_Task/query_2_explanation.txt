Query 2: Find Top-Spending Customer

This query identifies the customer who spent the most overall by:
1. Grouping all orders by customer using GROUP BY
2. Calculating the sum of amounts for each customer using SUM()
3. Ordering the results in descending order by total spent using ORDER BY
4. Limiting the result to only the top customer using LIMIT 1

Expected Result: Alice with 20,000
This is calculated as:
- Alice: 5,000 + 3,000 + 10,000 + 2,000 = 20,000
- Bob: 8,000 + 4,000 = 12,000
- Charlie: 7,000 + 9,000 = 16,000

Alice is the top spender with a total of 20,000 across all her orders.
