Query 3: Calculate Average Order Value

This query calculates the average value of all orders by:
1. Using the AVG() function to compute the mean of all order amounts
2. The query considers all orders in the database without any filtering

Expected Result: 6,000
This is calculated as:
- Total sales: 48,000 (sum of all orders)
- Number of orders: 8
- Average = 48,000 / 8 = 6,000

The average order value represents the typical amount spent per order across all customers.
